- After completing the project, I reorganized the code, resulting in changes to the filenames. The original filenames have been updated as follows:
  - `Take_Read.py` => `camera_capture.py` 
  - `coord_trans.py` => `coordinate_conversion.py`
  - `real_to_motor_write_txt_test.py` => `motor_movement_control.py`
