## Video Demonstration

Watch the demonstration of the **YOLOv5 Lego Color Recognition and Robot Control** project [here](https://youtu.be/0idIP3sX8TI).


## Video Note

After completing the project, I reorganized the code, resulting in changes to the filenames. 
The original `coord_trans.py` has been renamed to `coordinate_conversion.py`, 
and `real_to_motor_write_txt_test.py` has been renamed to `motor_movement_control.py`.
